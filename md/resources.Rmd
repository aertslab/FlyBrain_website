# List of resources:

If we have too many pages/files, it might be nice to have a list of all the resources (with link to the corresponding page? <is it easy to implement?>)
  
example (check which ones apply to us):  [http://atlas.gs.washington.edu/mouse-atac/data/#ucsc-trackhub-and-bigwigs](http://atlas.gs.washington.edu/mouse-atac/data/#ucsc-trackhub-and-bigwigs){:target="_blank"}
      
    
accessibility (matrix): 
 - loom (scope link?) - (it has a region-cell probability subset)
 - should we also provide the global "counts matrix" (maybe counted on peaks?)
 - gene expression? (the exact matrix that we used...?)
