## Cell type info

** OLD version *** To update 

Has information about the different clusters/cell types, e.g. correspondence across datasets (RNA-ATAC), & within clusterings (e.g. different granularity within ATAC), it also has some notes from Jasper (e.g. neurotransmitter, whether it is glia/neuronâ€¦ & some clarifications, such as "confidence level", which cell types it might include [some are not just one cell type], or what was used to annotate it [e.g. specific marker]...)

Relevant columns (for website): 
- Cell type/ Cluster (ATAC)
- Long name/description  (for the website might need to be split into two)
- Certainty
To be updated: 
- Final clusters/version)
- Neurotransmitter 
- Matching cluster from RNA (`load("/ddn1/vol1/staging/leuven/stg_00002/lcb/saibar/Projects/FB_devel/20200220_MotifsInEnhancers/1_global/int_anyAnnot//annotCorrespondence.RData")`)
