## Region info 

** Could we include a search box to intersect with the regions in the dataset?? **

TODO:

- Add link to scope & ucsc next to regions (in all tables, not only this one...)

- add genes within 50kbp (currently only one, annotated with Chipseeker), and whether they are "linked" (by Genie3 or correlation of accessibility-expression )

- Format?

Relevant columns: 
- ?

regionInfo <- cto@region.data
