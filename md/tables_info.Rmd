### Gene regulatory networks for *adult* cell types

The ***Networks* tab** allows to query the eGRNs (TF-region-gene) for all the available adult cell types.

The remaining tabs allow to explore the data behind the eGRNs:

- DARs: Differentially accessible regions for each cell type

- Motif enrichment (on DARs, Topics and cell-type peaks)

- Transcription factors per cell type

- Regions per motif

- Region-gene link

- RNA markers

- Query by region: Search for a given region and obtain summary of all the information available.
