### Overview of cell types

Short description of the central brain cell types and their corresponding scRNA clusters:

- list of cells in the cluster

- motif enrichment of the DARs

- information on how they were annotated 

- validation (ex. for KCs)

- DL filters + clustering 

* Overview of the data available by cell type
* A "card" for each cell type with the summary of info? - To decide whether it is useful
