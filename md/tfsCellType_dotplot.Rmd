### TFs  per cell type

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
Expressed Transcription Factors (TFs) with motif/ChIP-seq enrichment on the differentially accessible regions for each cell type.

**Legend:**
- Dot size: The size of each dot in these dotplots represents the TF motifs' enrichment in the DAR's of the cell type
- Color: Average expression. For each TF the maximum value is converted to 1.
- TF-motif annotation: *High confidence* includes ___, *any* includes ____.

*Notes:*
- T4/T5 are not distinguishable in the scRNA-seq dataset, so the same RNA-cluster has been taken for the TF-expression for both cell types.
- CB-A, CB-B:
