# FAQ  & stats: 
  
- Interesting/frequent questions about gene regulation, in the brain and development...
- if they are addressed in the paper, a short answer + reference to paper section 
- Stats are quite boring to show in "text" in the paper (they can be summarized into a table instead) but having the web resource gives an alternative to show it in a more detailed/specific way...

> - It would be great if it were an easily editable page… so we can add more over time & if people can ask/comment…? (e.g. markdown, github/forum style?)
