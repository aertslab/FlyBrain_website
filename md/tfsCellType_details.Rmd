## TF-centric approach to explore scATAC and scRNA datasets 

- Allows to explore the details for the TFs from the previous heatmap: motif enrichment in the DARs of the scATAC dataset and their expression in the scRNA dataset.

- The cistromes are the union of "Motifs_up" and "ChIP_up" (i.e. motifs with high confidence annotations, and ChIP-seq enrichment, only on DAR-up region sets; motifs enriched in DARs for cell types without TF expression are ignored).


TO DO: 

- Motif clustering (Transfac or Stamp-> Color) 

- Add number of regions per motif?

- Link to cistrome (e.g. download?)

- Cistrome by cell type / intersection of targets

- Keep cistrome accessibility (or use in SCOPE?)
