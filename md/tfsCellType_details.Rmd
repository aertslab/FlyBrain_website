DODO: Check & update

**TF-centric approach to explore scATAC and scRNA datasets**

- Explore the details for the TFs from the previous heatmap: motif enrichment in the DARs of the scATAC dataset and their expression in the scRNA dataset.

- The cistromes are the "Motifs_up" (i.e. motifs with high confidence annotations, only on DAR-up region sets; motifs enriched in DARs for cell types without TF expression are ignored).

<!-- Possible improvements:  -->

<!-- - Motif clustering (Transfac or Stamp-> Color)  -->

<!-- - Add number of regions per motif? -->

<!-- - Link to cistrome (e.g. download?) -->

<!-- - Cistrome by cell type / intersection of targets -->

<!-- - Keep cistrome accessibility (or use in SCOPE?) -->
